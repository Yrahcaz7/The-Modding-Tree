# The Primordial Tree

An incremental game based on `The Prestige Tree`, made using the game engine `The Modding Tree`.

Includes a variety of mechanics, and has lots of cool colored text (can be disabled in settings.)

Note: if you want to fork this to make your own mod, look at the `Documentation` in the wiki, because there are a few things that are different or have been added to the original `The Modding Tree` by `Acamaeda`.

Additional note: if you get stuck, just look at the `Help` page in the wiki.
