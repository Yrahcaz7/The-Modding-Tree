# The Septenary Forest

A collection of incremental games made using the game engine The Modding Tree (TMT for short).

I have added various features and changed some things in the base TMT structure to better suit my mods.

Due to this, I maintain my own [documentation](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md), which should be used instead of TMT's if you are forking this repo to make your own mod.
