# The Primordial Tree

An incremental game based on `The Prestige Tree`, made using the game engine `The Modding Tree`.

Includes a variety of mechanics, and has lots of cool colored text (can be disabled in settings.)

Note: if you want to fork this to make your own mod, look in [this `docs` folder](docs/tutorials/getting-started.md), not the original `The Modding Tree` docs, because there are a few things that are different or have been added to the original.

Additional note: there is no save bank, but if you get stuck progressing in the game, you can use the `Help` page in the wiki. It is not super consistently updated, but it will most likely still prove helpful.
