# The Primordial Tree

An incremental game based on `The Prestige Tree`, made using the game engine `The Modding Tree`.

Includes a variety of mechanics, and has lots of cool colored text (can be disabled in settings.)

Note: if you want to fork this to make your own mod, look in this `Documentation` folder, not the original `The Modding Tree` docs, because there are a few things that are different or have been added to the original `The Modding Tree`.

Additional note: if you get stuck progressing in the game, just look at the `Help` page in the wiki. It is not super consistently updated, but it will most likely still prove helpful.
